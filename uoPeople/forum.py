# def print_circum(radius):
#     # Define a custom message based on the radius
#     if radius < 1:
#         message = "That's a tiny circle!"
#     elif radius > 10:
#         message = "Wow, that's a big circle!"
#     else:
#         message = "A standard-sized circle."

#     circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius

#     # Add some creativity to the output message
#     print(
#         f"{message} The circumference of the circle with radius {radius} is approximately {circumference:.5f}.")


# # Call 1: Radius = 5.0
# print_circum(5.0)
# output = "A standard-sized circle. The circumference of the circle with radius 5.0 is approximately 31.41593."

# # Call 2: Radius = 7.5
# print_circum(7.5)


# # Call 3: Radius = 3.14159
# print_circum(3.14159)


# # Explanation: I defined a function print_circum that takes the radius of a circle as an argument. Inside the function, I calculated the circumference of the circle using the formula 2Ï€r, where r is the radius of the circle. Then, I displayed the result using the print() function. I called the function with three different values of radius: 5.0, 7.5, and 3.14159. The output of the program is shown below.

# # Example usage:
# item1_price = 200.0
# item2_price = 400.0
# item3_price = 600.0

# calculate_total_cost(item1_price, item2_price, item3_price)

# # Explanation: I defined a function calculate_total_cost that takes the prices of three different items (item1_price, item2_price, and item3_price) as arguments. Inside the function, I calculated the total cost of each individual item, which is simply the price of that item. Then, I calculated the cost of each combo by adding the prices of the items in the combo and subtracting 10% of the total cost of the combo. then calculate the cost of various combinations of items: combo1_cost: Combining item 1 and item 2, with a 10% discount applied combo2_cost: Combining item 2 and item 3, with a 10% discount applied combo3_cost: Combining item 1 and item 3, with a 10% discount applied combo4_cost: Combining all three items (gift pack), with a 25% discount applied. Finally, I displayed the results using the print() function. I called the function with the prices of three items as arguments.
